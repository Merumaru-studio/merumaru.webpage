        <h3>(Workstation 1) Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2023)</h3>
        <p>Ryzen 7 7745HX</p>
        <p>NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU</p>
        <p>Upgraded to 48GB RAM</p>

        <h3>(Workstation 2) Lenovo Legion 7i (2024)</h3>
        <p>Intel Core i9-14900HX (14th gen)</p>
        <p>RTX 4060</p>
        <p>32GB RAM</p>

        <h3>(Workstation 3) Self-built tower</h3>
        <p>Ryzen 7 5800X</p>
        <p>AMD Radeon RX 6800</p>
        <p>Currently only 16GB RAM (because of RAM shortage)</p>
        <p>NZXT B570 Mainboard</p>
        <p>
            We are using Workstation 3 mostly for hosting a server, Storage
            and if necessary as one node for CPU rendering, maybe video editing 
            in post production later on. 
            It urgently needs to be upgraded with an Nvidia GPU (not because we want to, 
            but because Arnold requires an Nvidia GPU) and it also urgently needs more RAM.
        </p>

        <h3>Future storage plans</h3>
        <p>
            In the close future we are thinking of getting a proper NAS, 
            for better accesible and shareable files and storage solution. 
            Especially for co working.
        </p>

        <h3>Tracking tool</h3>
        <p>
            As a tracking tool we are still deciding what to do. 
            We like Autodesk Flow Production Tracking, though it is expensive (formerly shotgun), 
            while the other viable options lack some features and also cost money.
        </p>

        <h3>Software choices</h3>
        <p>
            We decided to use Maya (Indie License), for two main reasons: 
            We learned with maya during our study and learned to like it. 
            At the same time we can instantly get support from Autodesk if something goes south, 
            which can be (out of experience) quite helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            For everything 2D (meaning storyboards, concept art etc.) we use Clip studio Paint.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Post production we will probably use Davinci Resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Texturing we are somewhat bound to Substance Painter, 
            even though we solely disagree with almost all of their policies, 
            we cant really find a reliable alternative. 
            Maybe one day we will have something.
        </p>

        <h3>Our AI policy</h3>
        <p>
            We have a strict policy against AI use in any part of our production pipeline, 
            we believe using AI is destroying creativity in every way. 
            We are not building Rockets or do science, also we learned grammar in school. 
            Therefore we dont want and will also not use AI. Ever! 
            That is a promise. 
            Everything you will see, is purely made by us!
        </p>

        <h3>Why this setup?</h3>
        <p>
            We got our gear to study, it was not meant to produce movies. 
            More professional gear is just incredibly expensive, 
            that's why we will work with what we currently have. 
            To make our Tools more stable, we are currently switching to Rocky Linux.
