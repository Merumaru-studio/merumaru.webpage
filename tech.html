                <h3>Workstation 2 – Lenovo Legion 7i (2024)</h3>
                <ul class="specs">
                    <li>Processor: Intel Core i9-14900HX (14th Generation)</li>
                    <li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060</li>

                <h3>Workstation 3 – Custom-Built Tower</h3>
                <ul class="specs">
                    <li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>
                    <li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6800</li>
                    <li>RAM: Currently 16 GB (limited due to shortage)</li>

                <p class="usage">
                    This machine is mainly used for hosting our server, running NAS storage, and occasionally as a CPU render node. It may also support video editing tasks in post-production later.  
                    <strong>Urgent upgrades needed:</strong> NVIDIA GPU (required for Arnold renderer compatibility) and significantly more RAM.

            <h2>Planned Infrastructure Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                In the near future we intend to add a <strong>UGREEN NAS</strong> system to improve file accessibility, centralized storage and real-time collaboration when working together.

            <h2>Production Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                We are still deciding on the best tracking solution.  
                <strong>Autodesk Flow Production Tracking</strong> (formerly Shotgun) is our preferred choice due to its feature set, but the price is quite high.  
                Most affordable alternatives currently lack important functionality we would need.

            <h2>Software Stack</h2>

            <h3>3D – Modeling, Animation & Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Autodesk Maya (Indie license)</strong><br>
                We chose Maya for two main reasons: we already learned and grew to love it during our studies, and Autodesk provides fast, direct support when critical issues arise (which — based on experience — can be extremely helpful).
            </p>

            <h3>2D – Storyboards, Concept Art & Illustration</h3>
            <p>Clip Studio Paint</p>

            <h3>Post-Production & Color Grading</h3>
            <p>DaVinci Resolve</p>

            <h3>Texturing</h3>
            <p>
                Substance Painter (current standard)<br>
                We strongly disagree with many of Adobe’s policies regarding this tool, but unfortunately we have not yet found a truly reliable, production-ready alternative. We hope this changes in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Strict No-AI Policy</h2>
            <p class="highlight">
                We have a strict policy against using AI in <strong>any</strong> part of our production pipeline.<br>
                We believe AI destroys creativity rather than enhancing it.<br>
                We are not building rockets or conducting scientific research — and we actually learned grammar in school.<br><br>
                <strong>We do not want AI. We will not use AI. Ever.</strong><br>
                That is a promise.<br>
                Everything you see from us is 100% human-made.

            <h2>Why This Setup?</h2>
            <p>
                Our current hardware was originally purchased for studying purposes — it was never intended to produce short films or animated projects at a professional level.<br>
                Truly professional workstations and render nodes are prohibitively expensive for us at this stage.<br>
                Therefore we are deliberately working with what we already own and continuously optimizing the software environment.<br>
                As one important stability improvement we are currently migrating our main machines to <strong>Rocky Linux</strong>.
