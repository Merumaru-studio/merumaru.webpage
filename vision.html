    <p>Welcome — you made it to one of the coolest places on the web.</p>
    <p>This is the website of a starting animation studio that uses… let’s just say unconventional software and hardware for 2026.</p>
    <p>To explain how this happened, I need to tell a short story.</p>
    <p>One day I came back from a long trip to Japan and just wanted to relax and watch my favorite TV show on my Apple TV. But I couldn’t — not because of Wi-Fi problems, but because Apple disabled access to TV shows I had already bought.</p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Because I usually charge my account using gift cards. I bought some of them in Japan, in a different currency, which caused my account to switch to the Japanese region. That meant I could no longer watch the shows I purchased overseas.</p>
    <p>You’d think I could just switch it back, right?</p>
    <p>Nope. To do that, I would have to spend all remaining money on the account — down to exactly 0 yen. I had 652 yen left. Basically impossible to spend perfectly. Support told me I should just connect a credit card to fix it.</p>
    <p>And yes — I really didn’t want to do that. That’s literally why I use gift cards.</p>
    <p>That was the moment where my thought process started.</p>
    <p>Even if it sounds dramatic, I realized something simple: we used to own things.</p>
    <p>I could buy a CD and listen to it forever. I could resell it. I could rip it to my iPod. Same with DVDs. And to some extent, software.</p>
    <p>That’s mostly gone now.</p>
    <p>Everything is a subscription. Everything depends on accounts, licenses, and internet access. We don’t really own our tools or media anymore — we just have permission to use them until someone decides otherwise.</p>
    <p>As someone who wants to create digital worlds — as a 3D artist, animator, and game developer — that feels wrong. Creative tools should feel stable and dependable, not temporary.</p>
    <p>I want to make people feel strong emotions. I want to tell stories and build worlds people care about. That part matters more than constantly chasing the newest tools.</p>
    <p>Anyway — enough philosophy. Let’s talk about the project.</p>
    <p>This project is mainly built around a short film idea I have (codename “Doggo”). It will mostly be animated in 3D.</p>
    <p>Here’s where the practical problem starts: I’m still a student. I learned Autodesk Maya and really like working with it, but I only have a student license, which means I can’t use it commercially.</p>
    <p>Some people will say: “Just use Blender.”</p>
    <p>And yes — I know Blender is powerful, open-source, and free. But switching tools would mean a long learning phase before I can actually realize my idea. I also genuinely like Maya’s workflow and UI. That’s subjective, but it matters.</p>
    <p>The other problem is hardware. I simply don’t have the kind of modern machine needed to render a full 3D short film comfortably.</p>
    <p>So I started looking in a different direction: older software and hardware.</p>
    <p>That’s when I found Maya 7, from the time when Maya was still made by Alias. You could actually buy the software and own it. No subscriptions. No logins. Just software that runs.</p>
    <p>Of course, software from that era doesn’t run nicely on modern systems. So after a lot of research, I started looking for hardware from around 2005 — what I personally think of as a golden era of 3D animation production.</p>
    <p>And surprisingly, you can still find incredibly powerful machines from that time for very reasonable prices — dual Xeon CPUs, Quadro graphics cards, massive amounts of RAM.</p>
    <p>Yes, by modern standards this hardware is obsolete.</p>
    <p>But movies like Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story were made with tools from this era. And they still look amazing today.</p>
    <p>So that’s where the idea was born:</p>
    <p>Build a retro animation workstation, make it run properly, and use it to create my film.</p>
